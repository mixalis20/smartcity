app.delete("/api/user/:id", (req, res, next) => {
    db.run(
        'DELETE FROM user WHERE id = ?',
        req.params.id,
        function (err, result) {
            if (err){
                res.status(400).json({"error": res.message})
                return;
            }
            res.json({"message":"deleted", changes: this.changes})
    });
})


In this case, we use app.delete() and a variable expression (:id)  to map the user id of the request.
Then, we run a DELETE command filtered by the user id (req.params.id)
If everything is ok, we return a JSON response, including the number of rows affected (changes). If the user was already deleted, or the id was not found, the value will be 0.
